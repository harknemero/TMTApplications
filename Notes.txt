***IMPORTANT***
	If zaber controller is switched out to a controller with a different device ID, then program will not work 
	until the new ID is set in the source code in ZaberCTRL.deviceID. Program must then be recompiled.

***IMPORTANT***
	If the ThicknessTest application ever fails to update data while running a test sequence, consider this:
	form1.runRowThicknessTestRoutine() is called asynchronously from TestRowButton_Click(). This results in many
	cross-thread transactions which do not work under certain conditions (ie: while debugging). It's possible this 
	program may not function correctly on some machines.
